### What is SWOS?
Sensible World of Soccer is a 1994 football video game designed and developed by Sensible Software as the sequel to their 1992 game Sensible Soccer. It combines a 2D football game with a comprehensive manager mode. The game includes contemporary season data of professional football from around the world, with a total number of 1,500 teams and 27,000 players. (see [Wikipedia's page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensible_World_of_Soccer)) The game currently is actively maintained and regularly updated by community gathered around [SensibleSoccer.de](https://sensiblesoccer.de) website allowing to compete in numerous online tournaments, competitions and leagues.

### What's inside?
* All FIFA affiliated national teams
* All CONIFA affiliated teams. > jump to [CONIFA @Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederation_of_Independent_Football_Associations)
* All NON-FIFA national teams but members of regional confederations + teams currently suspended because of various reasons

The plan is to expand the database by adding additional teams that may be part of other organizations like WUFA, COSANFF etc.
Help would be appreciated to make sure we've got every existing team available so it's possible to cover whatever imaginable football tournament on this planet. :smile:
